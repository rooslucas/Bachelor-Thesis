**Abstract**
The prediction of (drops in) vigilance can be useful in the prevention of car crashes. Previous work showed that temperature data, demographic data and subjective measurements can be useful in these predictions. With machine learning this study explores these different features as possible predictors of vigilance in the Brief Stimulus Reaction Time task (BSRT). Three different Random Forest models were built, and a naïve model was created for the evaluation of these models. Temperature was measured with iButtons and a FLIR camera four seconds prior to the target presentation. Results show that features measured with the FLIR camera useful predictors of vigilance are. Especially the forehead temperature. However, the accuracy scores of the models are just slightly better than the naïve model. So, further research should explore these features further and confirm these findings.
